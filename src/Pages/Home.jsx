        Hi, my name is Rune. <br></br>
        <br></br>I`m a 33 year old front-end developer, who`s currently
        participating in a 1 year front-end developer course called Kodehode
        organized by Jobloop AS. <br></br>
        <br></br>My background is 10 years in the onshore oil and gas industry,
        but my passion has always been within tech. Currently I`m well versed in
        CSS, HTML and Javascript, and React.<br></br> <br></br>My goal is to
        become a full-stack developer at some point.
